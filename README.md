# RaceOrganizer


### Description

Creating new races may sometimes have difficulties when it comes to organising and managing all the participants. So our application is going to take care of that. The race to be organised, could be a normal marathon or a race with checkpoints where participants will gain points for answering questions correctly. There are already companies that have a hard time managing races with checkpoints, so this application will solve a real life problem of a potential customer. Currently one of the companies’ organising and managing of races is done through excel worksheet which makes it extremely uncomfortable to keep track of all participants and their points.

Race Organiser is an application for creating and tracking races

#### Actors:
* Participant: participates in the competition.
* Moderator: asks questions to the participants, and register the points to the system.
* Creator: the person that creates the competition, creates the checkpoints.
